# Initialize Git

Using `cd`, navigate inside the folder 'GitPractice.' 

Type `git init` and hit enter.

This initializes the Git repository. It _sets the stage_ for the magic you want to create! 

### Create a file in your folder. 

Back in the command line, we're going to make our own cheatsheet as a plain text markdown file.

Make sure you're navigated inside your GitPractice folder. Use `cd` or `cd ..` as needed.

Type `touch cheatsheet.md` The '.md' extension means "markdown." You can use `touch` to create other types of files too: `touch [name].[extension]`.

### Open your file.

`subl cheatsheet.md` will let you get started.

Whatever text editor pops up should be the one that you set in your `git config`. We have configured it to use Sublime. To change your text editor, edit the `.git/config`. 

Using markdown style, give your document a title, insert your name and today's date.

After opening your file in your text editor, add or make whatever changes you would like. CTRL + S saves the file, SHIFT + CTRL + W closes the Sublime file. Remember how to open files (described right above!).

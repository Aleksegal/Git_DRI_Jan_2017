Today, we're going to learn how to use Git, GitHub and markdown in order to develop a workflow for collaborative, version-controlled projects in digital environments. 

**Workshop Goal**: Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub.

If we have time, we're going to do a challenge that practices forking and pull requests on GitHub using our sample data set! 

Let's get started! Here's our agenda:

### Brief Overview: Git, GitHub, Markdown, and Why

### Git Config
Set up your git and GitHub account.

### Command Line
Create a Git repo with a file. 

### Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push
Make local changes, track them, and push them to a remote repo.

### Forking and Pull Requests

#### [Workshop Evaluation] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Q6dYD6emcNlOTA6oeJmVc3Z-qKvWGGhE_SjVnVRWHbI/viewform)

Today, we're going to learn how to use Git, GitHub and markdown in order to develop a workflow for collaborative, version-controlled projects in digital environments. 

**Workshop Goal**: Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub.

If we have time, we're going to do a challenge that practices forking and pull requests on GitHub using our sample data set! 

Let's get started! Here's our agenda:

#### [What is Git, GitHub and Markdown?](2_conceptOverview.md)

#### [Configuring Git and GitHub](3_gitConfig.md)
Set up your git and GitHub account.

#### [Using Command Line to Set the Stage](4_commandLine.md)
Create a Git repo with a file. 

#### [Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push](5_gitAction.md)
Make local changes, track them, and push them to a remote repo.

#### [Git for Collaboration](6_forkPull.md)
Forking and Pull Requests

_I have linked the [glossary](glossary.md) and [helpful commands](helpfulcommands.md) at the bottom of each page._

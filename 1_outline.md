Today, we're going to learn how to use Git, GitHub and markdown in order to develop a workflow for collaborative, version-controlled projects in digital environments. 

**Workshop Goal**: Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub.

If we have time, we're going to do a challenge that practices forking and pull requests on GitHub using our sample data set! 

Let's get started! Here's our agenda:

#### [Reviewing the Command Line](4_commandLine.md)
Using the Command Line to create a Git repository (AKA repo) and a file. 

#### [What is Git, GitHub and Markdown?](2_conceptOverview.md)
A conceptual overview of what this is about.

#### [Configuring Git](3_gitConfig.md)
Set up Git on your computer.

#### [Sign up for GitHub]
Sign up for a GitHub account, and connecting it to the Git you just set up on your computer.

_Break_

#### [Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push](5_gitAction.md)
Make local changes, track them, and push them to a remote repo.

#### [Git for Collaboration](6_forkPull.md)

## Git Push

Now that our local and remote repos are connected, let's `push` our local repo to its remote directory. 

In the command line, type:

`git push -u origin master` (this pushes to the master branch)

You'll then be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Complete this step, then refresh GitHub in the browser to see your changes. 

Cheer wildly! (Cue applause)

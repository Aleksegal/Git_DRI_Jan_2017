Here's a glossary for the basic Git and Github terms that you'll need. 

If there's anything missing, remember that you can fork this repo, add what you'd like to see, and send a pull request!


**git**: the version-control tool that lives on your computer. 
**working directory**: a group of files you're in the process of editing.
**repository**: the data structure in which git stores its information on the files and the changes that have occurred in each.
**repo**: when you just don't have time to type 'repository!'
**Github**: the hosting service that stores your repos and allows others to interact with them
**fork**: the way others interact with and can modify your Github repos. Forking makes a copy of someone's repo in a way that connects back to the original repo, but lets you modify it without altering the original.
**clone**: a local copy of a repo you've forked. cloning lets you work offline. 
**push**:
**pull**:
**pull request**:

**branch**:
**master branch**:

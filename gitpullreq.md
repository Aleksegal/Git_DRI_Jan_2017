Asking to add to another repository

## Pulling

Once you are comfortable making changes to your own files and pushing them from your local directory to your GitHub repository, you can explore cloning someone else's repository. When you wish to contribute to the repository in question, you can issue a pull request. This request asks the master branch to consider *pulling* the changes and merging them with the master version. When people are working in a modular way, these changes can run without much conflict.  

For more information, please check out this [pull request tutorial](http://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)

Pull requests may also be submitted in the GUI on GitHub.com.

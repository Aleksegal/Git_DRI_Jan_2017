# What is git? 

**Git** is a version control tool. It lives on your computer [is local], and is accessed through the command line. 

Git tracks changes when the user tells it to: `git add` cues up revisions, and `git commit -a` adds modified files. All files live in the `.git` repository--again, on your computer.

#### Remember: git is local.
#### Git is the power behind *version control*.

# What is GitHub?

**Github** is a hosting service for git repositories. You must first set up an account and configure it on your computer. Once your local **git** repository and **Github** are connected, you can make copies of other users' repositories, edit them, and send your proposed changes back to the user who can then choose to incorporate your work into their repository. 

#### Remember: Github _connects_ git repositories.
#### GitHub is the power behind *collaboration*.

# Vocab time!

Both **git** and **GitHub** have specific language for their workflows. 

* **Repo**: short for repository. This is where your git files live on your computer, or where your GitHub files live remotely.

You can create repos by either **forking** an existing repo on Github, or creating your own in git.

In command line:

`mkdir [name]`
`cd [name]`
`git init`

You **fork** a user's repository on **Github** in order to create a copy. Forking gives you the freedom to experiment without worry of compromising the source document.

A **clone** is a local copy of a repository. We might think of **forking** as a way of cloning on Github, and **cloning** as a way of copying in git. Some users like to clone their repo after they've forked it; this means they can edit their local copy without having to be online, and then push changes once they're online again.
